# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction

### Objectives

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate collecting, working and cleaning
a real-life data set.

### Context

One of the most exiting areas in data science is wearable computing. See, for 
instance [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike and Jawbone are racing
to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

This project develops a tidy dataset starting from an existing dataset representing
data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A
full description is available at [the site where the data was obtained](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
